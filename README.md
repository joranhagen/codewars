# Codewars repository
This repository contains the solutions or work-in-progress solutions for the problem on codewars. Sub folders are created for problems for different languages.

Secondarily, this repository acts as a way for me to practise random programming related problems and skills. One of these is making readable and usefull **README** files for my repositories (difficulty impossible).

## Languages
- [x] Python
- [X] C
